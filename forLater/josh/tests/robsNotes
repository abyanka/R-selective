notes

see bottom of test.groupfs.R

1. with n=100,  p=120,14 groups, groupfs(x, y,index)  returned
 

  Error in checkargs.groupfs(x, index, maxsteps) : 
  maxsteps is too large. If the largest groups are included the model will be saturated/overdetermined

should have a sensible default so this doesn;t happen


2. a=groupfs(x,y,index,maxsteps=4)
groupfsInf(a)   gives


Using sigma value:  
Step 1 - computing p-value for group 14 
Step 2 - computing p-value for group 12 
Step 3 - computing p-value for group 1 
Step 4 - computing p-value for group 13 
Warning messages:
1: In groupfsInf(a) :
  p > n/2, and sigmahat = 0.434 used as an estimate of sigma; you may want to use the estimateSigma function
2: In groupfsInf(a) :
  P-value NaNs of the form 0/0 converted to 0. This typically occurs for numerical reasons in the presence of a large signal-to-noise ratio.
> aa

Standard deviation of noise (specified or estimated) sigma = 0.434
Error in lapply(pvals$support, size) : object 'pvals' not found



3.  groupfs  has a sigma arg listed in the Rd file, but it's  not in the function??

you need to do a R CMD check to  pick up this stuff
