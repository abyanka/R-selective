Description: A collection of functions that performs inference after selection for forward stepwise regression, least angle regression, the lasso, and the many normal means problem. Some of this code is based on python code developed by the Selective Inference Development Team (Jonathan Taylor and others at Stanford University, http://github.com/selective-inference/selective-inference).
